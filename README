This is a port to github of my old project 
http://code.google.com/p/chrome-scrapbook-project/
There were 5000 users of this project which inspired me
to dig up this project from the dead to add new features to it.

This code makes up the chrome extension called scrapbook
What I plan to do with it now is polish it and make it better.
1) Rethink the design and sit with Eric on redesign..
2) Make changes as per Eric's suggestions
3) Add some features as per http://code.google.com/p/chrome-scrapbook-project/issues/list
